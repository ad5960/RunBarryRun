## Introduction
“Run Barry Run” is a pathfinding algorithm visualizer using PyGame. Our project aims to create an interactive visualization of multiple famous pathfinding algorithms to compare how they perform when reaching from a source to a destination while avoiding obstacles in between.

Users can place a source point (which in our case is the character Flash – Barry Allen, a famous superhero from DC Comics), a destination point, and obstacles between the source and the destination point using mouse clicks. The essence of the project lies in simulating pathfinding algorithms like A*, Dijkstra, Depth-First Search, and Breadth-First Search, to dynamically find a path from the source to the destination while navigating around obstacles. 

## Technologies Used
This project leverages the below technologies
-	PyGame: Used for creating the graphical visualization of the grid environment & character movement
-	Python: We used Python for implementing the pathfinding algorithms, grid logic, and user interactions

## Pathfinding Algorithms Used
The project mostly uses four pathfinding algorithms:
1.	A*: It’s a widely-used algorithm that combines the aspects of Dijkstra’s algorithm and a heuristic to find the most efficient path.
2.	Dijkstra: A pathfinding algorithm that explores all possible paths to find the shortest path possible 
3.	Depth-First Search (DFS): This algorithm explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking and exploring the neighbor path.
4.	Breadth-First Search (BFS): This algorithm explores all the neighbor nodes at the current depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
